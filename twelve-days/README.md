# Twelve Days

In this exercise, you'll create a class to output the lyrics to the traditional English Christmas carol ["The Twelve Days of Christmas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)) (complete lyrics below).

In this song, each verse is built on top of the previous verses in a repeating pattern. Can you use Ruby to build up the repeated lyrics programmatically?

Note on testing: Unlike previous exercises, this exercise doesn't include an extensive set of test cases. Instead, there is an "acceptance" test to make sure that the final output is correct. A file called `song.txt` is included with the exercise, but this is to be used for the acceptance test to validate the solution, not as part of the solution itself.
